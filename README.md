> Removing certain tags from the ClassicPress head section is a great way to enhance site performance. _Why load assets for emoji if your site doesn't even use emoji?_ The Head Cleaner plugin will cause your site to make fewer external requests, request fewer internal resources, and consume less bandwidth overall â€“ which leads to faster pages and happier visitors.

### How do I use the plugin?
Go to `Dashboard > Settings > Head Cleaner`, tick the boxes for the items you want to remove, and then save the settings. You can take a look at your page source on the frontend to verify that it worked.
